Bookmarks Manager

HTML/AJAX interface, PHP backend, xml storage file

This was a bookmark manager I wrote within a few days.
It stored all my bookmarks in an xml file in a webserver folder.
Each bookmark had one or more user-defined tags, identifying category, type, etc.
The user would open the manager page, filter through all the bookmarks by checking off the related tags, then click the desired link.
I also wrote a python script to parse through an exported HTML file (from Firefox) of my existing bookmarks, and convert it to my xml version.
